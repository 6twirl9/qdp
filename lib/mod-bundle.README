This mod provides an alternative procedure to generate
the source and header files required to build QDP/C.

It bundles the 7439 sources files, for all precision
& Nc (colour) combinations, into less than 300 files.

The makefiles supplied with the official QDP/C distribution
have NOT been modified to work with mod-bundle.

Run mod-bundle/util/example.sh to install.

PS Remember to set GTAR=gtar GSED=gsed where necessary.
