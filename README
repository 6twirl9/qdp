SciDAC QDP C interface -- Level 2 data parallel routines

This package uses the standard GNU configuration script.  See the file
INSTALL for datails on compiling and installing.  It is recommended that
QDP be compiled with a C99 compliant compiler (or at least one that
understands the restrict keyword).  Linking to QDP may also require a C99
compiler or a redefinition of restrict before including the QDP header.
If you get errors like 'error: syntax error before "dest"' then most likely
you are not using your compiler in C99 mode.  Check your compiler
documentation to find the appropriate option (for gcc try -std=c99 or
for xlc try -qlanglvl=stdc99).

Documentation is included in the doc directory.  This is not included in
the installation.  See the README file in the doc directory for details.
